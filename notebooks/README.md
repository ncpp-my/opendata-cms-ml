# ML Tutorials using Jupyter Notebooks

These notebooks were developed by three data science interns from INTEC in December 2021, and serve as educational tools on the application of machine learning methods on large datasets (in this case, High Energy Physics datasets). The datasets used skimmed down are versions from CERN Open Data, with the original ones available [here](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/12100).
